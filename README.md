# AeroDB

AeroDB is a lightweight experimental database implemented in Rust. It serves as a playground for learning how B-Tree based storage engines and simple SQL parsers work.

## Building

AeroDB uses [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). To build the project run:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Running

After building, launch the CLI with:

```bash
cargo run
```

A prompt will appear where you can enter simple SQL commands (CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, DELETE) or type `.exit` to quit.

## Development Approach

Development follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** workflow:

1. **Write failing tests** for new features or bug fixes.
2. **Implement** the minimal code to make those tests pass.
3. **Run the full test suite** to ensure all tests succeed.
4. **Refactor** for readability and maintainability while keeping tests green.
5. Add additional tests for uncovered edge cases.

## TODO

- [ ] Improve SQL parser to support more complex statements.
- [ ] Flesh out transaction support and write corresponding tests.
- [ ] Document storage internals and page layout.
